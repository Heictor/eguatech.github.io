Rocket v0.2 packs a ton of new features, fixes, and general improvements. Much of the development in v0.2 was led by the community, either through reports via the <a href=https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues>GitHub issue tracker</a> or via direct contributions. In fact, there have been <strong>20 unique contributors</strong> to Rocket's codebase since Rocket's initial introduction! Community feedback has been incredible. As a special thank you, we include the names of these contributors at the end of this article.<p></p><a href=../index.html>read more ►</a><br><br></article></div></section><footer class=grid><div class=container><div class="col mobile-hide"><a href=https://sergio.bz>© 2016-2019 Sergio Benitez</a></div><div class="col centered"><img src=../v0-4/images/logo-small.svg alt="Small Rocket Logo"></div><div class="col text-right mobile-hide"><a href=#>BACK TO TOP Δ</a></div></div></footer><script>function toggleOptions(){if(!(870<=screen.width)){var e=document.querySelector("nav.version-select options");e.style.display="none"===e.style.display?"block":"none"}}</script><script>!function(){var r=null,u=0,a=document.querySelector(".front.clouds"),c=document.querySelector(".back.clouds"),s=20,d=5;window.requestAnimationFrame(function e(n){if(r||(r=n),n-u<50)window.requestAnimationFrame(e);else{var o=n-r,t=s*(o/1e3),i=d*(o/1e3);a.style.backgroundPositionX=-t+"px",c.style.backgroundPositionX=-i+"px",u=n,window.requestAnimationFrame(e)}})}()</script>
